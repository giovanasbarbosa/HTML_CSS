            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
            And sorry I could not travel both <br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
            And looked down one as far as I could <br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;

            Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
            And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
            Though as for that the passing there <br>
            Had worn them really about the same,

            In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.

            I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
            I took the one less traveled by, <br>
            And that has made all the difference.
