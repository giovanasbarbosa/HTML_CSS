            <p id="page">
                    This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary<br>
                    The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.<br>
                    The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God<br>
                    Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility<br>
                    Fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place.<br>
                    Separated from my house by a row of headstones.<br>
                    I simply cannot see where there is to get to.<br>
                    <br>
                    The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right,<br>
                    White as a knuckle and terribly upset.<br>
                    It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet<br>
                    With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.<br>
                    Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky —<br>
                    Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection<br>
                    At the end, they soberly bong out their names.<br>
                    <br>
                    The yew tree points up, it has a Gothic shape.<br>
                    The eyes lift after it and find the moon.<br>
                    The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary.<br>
                    Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls.<br>
                    How I would like to believe in tenderness –<br>
                    The face of the effigy, gentled by candles,<br>
                    Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes.<br>
                    <br>
                    I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering<br>
                    Blue and mystical over the face of the stars<br>
                    Inside the church, the saints will all be blue,<br>
                    Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,<br>
                    Their hands and faces stiff with holiness.<br>
                    The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild.<br>
                    And the message of the yew tree is blackness – blackness and silence.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    -Sylvia Plath
