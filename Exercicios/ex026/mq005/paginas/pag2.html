                    You do not do, you do not do<br>   
                    Any more, black shoe<br>
                    In which I have lived like a foot<br>
                    For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
                    Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.<br>
                    <br>
                    Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
                    You died before I had time—-<br>
                    Marble-heavy, a bag full of God<br>
                    Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
                    Big as a Frisco seal<br>
                    <br>
                    And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>   
                    Where it pours bean green over blue<br>   
                    In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>   
                    I used to pray to recover you.<br>
                    Ach, du.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>   
                    Scraped flat by the roller<br>
                    Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
                    But the name of the town is common.<br>   
                    My Polack friend<br>
                    <br>
                    Says there are a dozen or two.<br>   
                    So I never could tell where you<br>   
                    Put your foot, your root,<br>
                    I never could talk to you.<br>
                    The tongue stuck in my jaw.<br>
                    <br>
                    It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>   
                    Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
                    I could hardly speak.<br>
                    I thought every German was you.<br>   
                    And the language obscene<br>
                    <br>
                    An engine, an engine<br>
                    Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
                    A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>   
                    I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
                    I think I may well be a Jew.<br>
                    <br>
                    The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>   
                    Are not very pure or true.<br>
                    With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>   
                    And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
                    I may be a bit of a Jew.<br>
                    <br>
                    I have always been scared of you,<br>
                    With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>   
                    And your neat mustache<br>
                    And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
                    Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——<br>
                   <br> 
                    Not God but a swastika<br>
                    So black no sky could squeak through.<br>   
                    Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>   
                    The boot in the face, the brute <br>  
                    Brute heart of a brute like you.<br>
                    <br>
                    You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>   
                    In the picture I have of you,<br>
                    A cleft in your chin instead of your foot <br>  
                    But no less a devil for that, no not<br>   
                    Any less the black man who<br>
                    <br>
                    Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
                    I was ten when they buried you.<br>   
                    At twenty I tried to die<br>
                    And get back, back, back to you.<br>
                    I thought even the bones would do.<br>
                    <br>
                    But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>   
                    And they stuck me together with glue.<br>   
                    And then I knew what to do.<br>
                    I made a model of you,<br>
                    A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br>
                    <br>
                    And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>   
                    And I said I do, I do.<br>
                    So daddy, I’m finally through.<br>
                    The black telephone’s off at the root,<br>   
                    The voices just can’t worm through.<br>
                    <br>
                    If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two——<br>
                    The vampire who said he was you<br>   
                    And drank my blood for a year,<br>
                    Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
                    Daddy, you can lie back now.<br>
                    <br>
                    There’s a stake in your fat black heart<br>   
                    And the villagers never liked you.<br>
                    They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>   
                    They always knew it was you.<br>
                    Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
